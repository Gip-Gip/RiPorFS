#RiPorFS

***What Is It?***

The Ridged Portable File System, RiPorFS, is designed to be a solid FAT
replacement. Like FAT, it's slow, limited, and ugly, but it is designed not to
be limited by size.

***The Utilities Provided***

If you just came here to use it as an archiving utility, or your playing around with storage mediums on linux, here are a few utilities that you can use:

* RIPOR: the official V1 utility. Simple, limited and currently, development has been abandoned. Written in C89.

* crutil: The official V2 utility. It is in active development. Written in C89.
