#RiPorFS

***What Is It?***

The Ridged Portable File System, RiPorFS, is designed to be a solid FAT
replacement. Like FAT, it's slow, limited, and ugly, but it is designed not to
be limited by size.

***The Utilities Provided***

If you just came here to use it as an archiving utility, or your playing around with storage mediums on linux, here are a few utilities that you can use:

* RIPOR: the official V1 utility. Simple, limited and currently, development has been abandoned. Written in C89.

* crutil: The official V2 utility. It is in active development. Written in C89.

***Contributing***

There are many things I would like help with, such as:

* Adding ridge ideas to STANDARD.TXT
* Coming up with features for crutil
* Improving source code comments in crutil.c
* Improving crutil documentation
* Making sure empty lines are where they need to be (before comments and logical statements) in crutil.c
* Making sure the code is as portable and readable as possible (in C89) in crutil.c
* Bug testing crutil to death

Just doing one of those things, or anything else, will get you put in the AUTHORS.TXT file. Code contributions (excluding small spacing improvments and comment changes) will get your name placed in the authors portion of the splash and soucecode, as there are greatly appreceated.
