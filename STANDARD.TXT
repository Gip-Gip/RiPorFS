Ridge - an unsigned 8-bit integer either after the signature, after a null-terminated filename, or pointed to by another ridge.

v1:

RiPorFS = filesystem signature, ASCII
ridge value 255 = filename ridge, ASCII, terminated by null
ridge value 254 = end-of-filesystem marker
ridge value < 254 = file data, size given by ridge

v2:

utilities must support detection and conversion of LSB and MSB data
support for directories

exp128rpfs = filesystem signature, ASCII
ridge value 255 = end-of-filesystem marker
ridge value 254 = filename ridge, UTF-8, terminated by null
ridge value 253 = directory start ridge, UTF-8, terminated by null
ridge value 252 = directory end ridge
ridge value < 128 = file data, size given by ridge
