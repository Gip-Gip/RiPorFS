Ridge - an unsigned 8-bit integer either after the signature, after a
null-terminated filename, or pointed to by another ridge.

v1: *FINISHED*

RiPorFS = filesystem signature, ASCII
ridge value 255 = filename ridge, ASCII, terminated by null
ridge value 254 = end-of-filesystem marker
ridge value < 254 = file data, size given by ridge

v2: *IN DEVELOPMENT*

utilities must support detection and conversion of LSB and MSB data.

support for directories.

each ridge has a OMC8 checksum right before it, which covers the ridge
value and it's data.

exp128rpfs = filesystem signature, ASCII.

ridge value...
 255 = end-of-filesystem marker
 254 = filename ridge, UTF-8, terminated by null
 253 = directory start ridge, UTF-8, terminated by null
 252 = directory end ridge
 251 = timestamp, UTF-8, base 10, in Unix Time, termianted by null
 < 128 = file data, size given by ridge value

OMC8 checksum C example:

unsigned char OMC8(unsigned char *data, int size)
{
    unsigned char checksum = 0;
    int offset = 0;
    int incrementer = 0;
    int multiplier = 0;
    
    while(offset < size)
    {
        while(multiplier < offset)
        {
            incrementer = *(data + offset);
            while(incrementer != 0)
            {
                checksum ++;
                incrementer --;
                
                if(checksum == 255) checksum = 0;
            }
            
            multiplier ++;
        }
        
        multiplier = 0;
        offset ++;
    }
    return checksum;
}
